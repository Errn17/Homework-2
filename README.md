# Portfolio

// This is the readme page

Basically I just created a website using some bootstrap components. For the about me tab I just played around with a bunch of different components and found I liked the carousel one the most. I got to add more pictures in a slideshow kinda way, so I wanted to make that work on my site. Gave a pretty good intro to myself with some pictures to go along. I wasnt quite sure what to do with the contact page. Most of the things I found on bootstrap were just forms to fill out so I kinda just did what was shown in the example pics for that tab. I had to pick apart a few that bootstrap provided to get it pretty similar. I also added a card below it with my contact info in it. On the portfolio page I just added a few slideshows with some pictures from over the years. I figured I'd do that since those are basically a portfolio of my life.
